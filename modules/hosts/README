This module was tested on puppet 2.7.0, hiera 1.0.0

Installation
------------
1. Install lsit-hosts module
 
  Install the module by normal means.  You will also need to have puppet
  setup to work with hiera as a data store. 

  By default, the hosts module will write to /etc/hosts and use its own
  template.


2. Add site-wide host entries

  Site-wide values are stored in "hosts::site_hosts_hsh".  Add site-wide hosts
  entries to your common.yaml file or which ever file you use to store
  site-wide heira values.  Entries are organized into sections; 
  "Web Servers", by example below.  You must have at least one section.
  See example below.
  
## hosts vars
hosts::site_hosts_hsh:
  'Web Servers':
    - '10.0.16.10     yoda-priv.example.com yoda-priv'
    - '10.0.16.11     chewbacca.example.com www.example.com chewbacca'
    - '10.0.16.13     solo.example.com www2.example.com solo'
  'Log Servers':
    - '192.168.2.134     loghost1.example.com'
    - '192.168.2.167     loghost2.example.com'
    
= Result =

## Site-Wide Host Entries

# Web Servers
10.0.16.10     yoda-priv.example.com yoda-priv
10.0.16.11     chewbacca.example.com www.example.com chewbacca
10.0.16.13     solo.example.com www2.example.com solo

# Log Servers
192.168.2.134     loghost1.example.com
192.168.2.167     loghost2.example.com


3. Node-specific hosts entries
  Node-specific value ware stored in "hosts::node_hosts_hsh".  You can
  add hosts entries that are specific to a particular node by 
  configuring hiera to lookup node-specific values first. Adding
  the section "nodes/%{fqdn}" tells hiera took look for values 
  in nodes yaml file(e.g. nodes/lea.example.com.yaml) before it 
  searches the site-wide values.

= example hiera.yaml =
---
:backends: - yaml

:logger: console

:hierarchy: - nodes/%{fqdn}
            - common
:yaml:
   :datadir: /etc/puppet/hieradata


4.  Overriding template and hosts file path
  The template and hosts file path variables are stored in
  "hosts::hosts_tmpl" and "hosts::hosts_path", respectively.  You can override
  these values by setting them in either the site-wide or the 
  node-specific data store.
  
  Note: When overriding the "hosts::hosts_tmpl", puppet will search with
  respect to the default template directory.


5. Set "puppetheader" variable(optional)
  In general, it is a good idea to have a header on puppet-managed
  files.  The hosts module expects a variable named "puppetheader"
  to hold the puppet header string. By default, it uses 
  "Managed By Puppet".  Override this by adding the "puppetheader"
  value in your heira data store.
